## Introduction
Electron is a pioneering lending protocol built on Web3, revolutionizing decentralized finance (DeFi) with cutting-edge features and innovative lending solutions. Our platform prioritizes decentralization, empowering users to access lending services in a secure, transparent, and efficient manner.

## How It Works
Electron is the better approach to lending on-chain, which incorporates zero-knowledge proofs (zk proofs) as a powerful middleware. By leveraging zk proofs, users can increase their loan-to-value (LTV) ratio from the standard 80% up to an impressive 95%. This is achieved by zk-proofing ownership of assets such as soul-bound tokens, popular NFTs, or community memberships, without the need to reveal specific wallet addresses. Electron seamlessly integrates these zk proofs into its lending infrastructure, ensuring privacy and security while maximizing borrowing potential.

## Benefits
- With the ability to increase LTV ratios, users can unlock greater borrowing power, enabling them to seize new opportunities and achieve their financial goals. 

- Electron enhances privacy and security, allowing borrowers to maintain confidentiality while accessing additional borrowing capacity. 

## Next Iterations
In our next phase, Electron aims to pioneer under-collateralized lending in DeFi by leveraging zk-proofs on real-world assets (RWAs) and cross-chain metrics. This innovative approach will enable users to access loans without fully collateralizing, while still ensuring security and privacy. By zk-proofing ownership of RWAs and analyzing cross-chain data for risk assessment, Electron will establish more accurate lending models, revolutionizing decentralized finance and opening new avenues for borrowers and lenders alike.
